# Streaming App for Music ðŸŽµ

## Overview

This project is a **streaming app for music**, designed to manage users, playlists, songs, and listening history. The database schema is based on the provided **EER diagram**, and the application is implemented using **Python**, **FastAPI**, and **SQLAlchemy** for backend logic, with a **PostgreSQL** database.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Database Files**

#### `database/init_db.sql`

- **Purpose**: Defines the database schema based on the EER diagram.
- **Relation to EER Diagram**:
  - Implements all tables (`users`, `free_users`, `premium_users`, `artists`, `songs`, `playlists`, `playlist_songs`, `listening_history`, `subscriptions`).
  - Includes additional fields like `device_used` in `listening_history` and `position_in_playlist` in `playlist_songs`.
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Add constraints for data validation (e.g., `CHECK` constraints for valid dates).
  - Optimize indexes for frequently queried fields (e.g., `listened_at` in `listening_history`).

#### `database/seed_data.sql`

- **Purpose**: Populates the database with initial data for testing.
- **Relation to EER Diagram**:
  - Inserts sample data for all tables, ensuring relationships between entities are respected.
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Add more realistic and diverse data for testing edge cases.
  - Automate data generation for scalability.

### 2. **Backend Files**

#### `backend/config.py`

- **Purpose**: Stores the database connection string.
- **Relation to EER Diagram**:
  - Connects the application to the PostgreSQL database.
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Use environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`).
  - Add support for multiple environments (e.g., development, testing, production).

#### `backend/db.py`

- **Purpose**: Sets up the SQLAlchemy engine, session, and base class for ORM models.
- **Relation to EER Diagram**:
  - Provides the foundation for interacting with the database tables.
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Implement connection pooling for better performance.
  - Add logging for database queries.

#### `backend/models/users.py`

- **Purpose**: Defines ORM models for `users`, `free_users`, and `premium_users`.
- **Relation to EER Diagram**:
  - Implements the `users` table and its subtypes (`free_users`, `premium_users`).
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Add validation logic for user input (e.g., email format).
  - Implement methods for user-specific queries (e.g., fetching all playlists for a user).

#### `backend/models/songs.py`

- **Purpose**: (Empty) Will define ORM models for the `songs` table.
- **Relation to EER Diagram**:
  - Will implement the `songs` table and its relationship with `artists`.
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Add methods for querying songs by genre, artist, or release date.

#### `backend/models/playlists.py`

- **Purpose**: (Empty) Will define ORM models for `playlists` and `playlist_songs`.
- **Relation to EER Diagram**:
  - Will implement the `playlists` table and its many-to-many relationship with `songs` via `playlist_songs`.
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Add methods for managing playlists (e.g., adding/removing songs, reordering).

#### `backend/models/subscription.py`

- **Purpose**: (Empty) Will define ORM models for the `subscriptions` table.
- **Relation to EER Diagram**:
  - Will implement the `subscriptions` table and its relationship with `users`.
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Add methods for managing subscription renewals and cancellations.

---

### 3. **App Files**

#### `app/api.py`

- **Purpose**: Provides a REST API for interacting with the `users` table.
- **Relation to EER Diagram**:
  - Implements basic CRUD operations for the `users` table.
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Add endpoints for other tables (e.g., `songs`, `playlists`).
  - Implement authentication and authorization.

#### `app/visualizations.py`

- **Purpose**: (Empty) Will generate visualizations based on `listening_history`.
- **Relation to EER Diagram**:
  - Will analyze and visualize data from `listening_history` (e.g., most played songs, user activity).
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Use libraries like `Matplotlib` or `Plotly` for interactive charts.
  - Add support for exporting visualizations as images or PDFs.

#### `app/main.py` 

- **Purpose**: (Empty) Will serve as the entry point for the application.
- **Relation to EER Diagram**:
  - Will integrate all components (API, visualizations, database interactions).
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Add a CLI or web interface for user interaction.
  - Implement error handling and logging.

## Future Steps for High Achievement

### 1. **Database Enhancements** 

- **Normalization**: Ensure all tables are in at least 3NF to avoid redundancy.
- **Indexes**: Add indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., `email`, `listened_at`).
- **Stored Procedures**: Implement stored procedures for complex queries (e.g., generating user statistics).
- **Backups**: Set up automated backups for data integrity.

### 2. **Python Development**

- **ORM Models**: Complete the implementation of all ORM models.
- **Unit Tests**: Write tests for all models and API endpoints using `pytest`.
- **Error Handling**: Add robust error handling for database and API operations.
- **Performance**: Optimize queries and reduce API response times.

### 3. **API Development**

- **Endpoints**: Add endpoints for all tables and relationships.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for large datasets (e.g., songs, playlists).
- **Authentication**: Add user authentication and role-based access control.

### 4. **Visualizations**

- **User Insights**: Create dashboards for user activity and song popularity.
- **Export Options**: Allow users to export data as CSV or Excel files.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Use WebSockets for real-time updates in visualizations.

### 5. **Documentation**

- **API Docs**: Use tools like Swagger or Redoc to generate API documentation.
- **User Guide**: Write a guide for setting up and using the application.
- **Code Comments**: Add comments to all files for better maintainability.

## Key Considerations for Success

1. **Scalability**: Design the database and API to handle a growing number of users and songs.
2. **Security**: Protect sensitive data (e.g., user emails, subscription details).
3. **User Experience**: Focus on intuitive interfaces and fast response times.
4. **Testing**: Ensure all components are thoroughly tested to avoid bugs.
5. **Extensibility**: Design the system to easily accommodate new features (e.g., video streaming).
